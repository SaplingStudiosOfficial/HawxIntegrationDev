# Add Authentication to your PHP App in 5 Minutes

This is a minimalist example PHP app that shows how quickly you can add authentication to an existing application.

This is the finished project created from the tutorial [Add Authentication to your PHP App in 5 Minutes](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/09/five-minute-php-app-auth)

You can run this application from the built-in PHP server with the command below:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```
